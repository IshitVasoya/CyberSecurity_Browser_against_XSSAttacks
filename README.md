Securing User Browsing: Comparing Browsers and Extensions Effectiveness against XSS Attacks

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks pose a significant threat to web application security, with reflected XSS vulnerabilities presenting a
particularly challenging problem. In these attacks, malicious scripts injected into web applications are at once reflected to users'
browsers without proper validation. This project addresses the critical need to evaluate the effectiveness of different browser
configurations in mitigating reflected XSS attacks.

Our primary aim is to empirically decide which browser configurations offer the most robust defense against reflected XSS attacks.
This assessment will involve comprehensive testing of browsers both with and without extensions, as well as an examination of the
impact of Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implemented on target websites.

Through rigorous testing protocols, we will find browsers that prove inherent resilience against reflected XSS attacks, even in the
absence of extensions. Additionally, we will assess the efficacy of various browser extensions, such as ScriptBlock, NoScript, and
Counter XSS, in enhancing browser security and mitigating XSS vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, we will examine the practical implementation of CSP headers on target websites to confirm their role in XSS mitigation.
By analyzing browser responses to XSS payloads under different configurations, our aim is to offer conclusive insights into the
relative effectiveness of browser security features, extensions, and CSP implementations.

In essence, this project is a proactive step towards strengthening web application security and safeguarding users' online experiences.
